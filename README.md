# about
this is a collection of all my dotfiles

the way I've made it, a few functions require manually passing your sudo password to them in hyprland.conf
feel free to rewrite these, delete them, whatever, but if you want to use them remember to replace all instances of <PASSWORD> with your password
theres a few other instances in ~/.scripts/obsidian-fixer.sh, bdwn.sh & bup.sh, and startup.sh

# instructions
pretty easy, run the install.sh script and it should hopefully install just about everything
